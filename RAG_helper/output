Decision: BLUFF

Trigger:
- The phrase "we are looking to refresh another 50 workstations in Q4" implies a large-scale commitment, but it's mentioned as a potential future action, not a current requirement.
- The request for flexibility on the initial unit cost is made with an emphasis on getting the first PO signed off today, which suggests they're trying to negotiate without fully committing.
