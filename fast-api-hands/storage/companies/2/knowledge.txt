TACTICS:
1. **Bulk Threshold**: Push them to buy at least 20 units to unlock the $700 price and free installation.
2. **Health Argument**: Use the TechCorp stats (40% less absenteeism) to justify the cost.
3. **Warranty Confidence**: Emphasize the 5-year motor warranty to counter cheaper competitors.

FACTS:
1. **Specs**: Range 60-125cm. Speed 38mm/s. Bosch internals.
2. **Savings**: Bulk deal saves $100/desk + $50 installation = $150/desk savings.
