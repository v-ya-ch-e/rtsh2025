We’ve reviewed the proposal for the initial 20 units. While the specs match our engineering requirements, the current unit price is sitting about 10% above our allocated budget.

We view this as a pilot program; if these machines perform well, we are looking to refresh another 50 workstations in Q4. Considering the potential for a long-term partnership, what flexibility do you have on the initial unit cost to help us get this first PO signed off today?
